# GH-Mechfret-Kailh-Choc-mini
Custom drop-in replacement for the fret PCB for Guitar Hero controllers using Kailh Choc Mini switches. Please check the license before use.

This should fit all guitars, I hope? You need a washer probably for some guitars.

Side note: I actually havent ordered PCBs for this but i have test fitted it with a 3d printed one and it seems to work fine.
